She certainly attracted attention when she appeared completely naked in the HBO anthology series, “True Detective,” which helped earn her a spot on Maxim’s Hot 100 list in 2014.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_family_and_career>Early life, family, and career</span></h2><p>Alexandra Anna Daddario was born on 16 March 1986, in New York City. She along with her younger siblings, Matthew and Catharine Daddario, was raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her parents met in law school in Georgetown – her Italian-Irish father, Richard Daddario is a former federal prosecutor in New York City, who served as the head of NYPD’s counter-terrorism unit from 2010 to 2013, and her mother Christina is a lawyer. They divorced when Alexandra was in her early 30’s.</p><p>Her parents often brought Alexandra to watch a play, and one time she was noticed by a talent manager, who approached her parents to talk about her potential in acting for commercials. They then sent her to have acting lessons, and she was about 10 when she started to audition for commercials. Her first job was at age 12, when she became a hand model for a Barbie doll and said she tried hard to get her face to be seen on the screen.</p><p>It was pretty rough for a while as she went through the awkward teenage years, but after that, she began working on one project after another. Alexandra’s first acting gig on television was in ABC’s long-running soap opera, “All My Children,’ in which she was cast for the recurring role of a victimized teenager named Laurie Lewis from 2002 to 2003. It was followed by minor roles in movies, and guest appearances in hit TV series such as “Law & Order,” “The Sopranos,” and “Nurse Jackie.”</p><p>After many years in the industry, Alexandra finally landed her first starring role in the movie adaptation of The New York Times best-selling novel “The Lightning Thief” by Rick Riordan, then reprised her role in the sequel entitled “Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,” which premiered in 2013.</p><p>Her rise in popularity brought in more work opportunities, but her acting career really took off in 2014. when she appeared in season one of the TV series “True Detective” in which her character, Lisa Tragnetti, was the young mistress of Detective Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson. She said that doing a nude scene was a tactical decision on her part, as she wanted to be taken seriously as an actress, and it worked, as producers and directors saw that she could pull off more mature and bold characters. More meaty or starring roles came her way after that.</p><h2><span id=Dating_history>Dating history</span></h2><p>Attending an exclusive school for girls for a time during high school meant that she didn’t really date. ‘The idea of boys was amazing to me, like, all I ever wanted to do was kiss boys and be around boys,’ she said. It was pretty exciting for her when she made out with a boy for a “Got Milk” ad when she was around 13 or 14 – she knew that her parents didn’t know what was happening during her commercial auditions.</p><p>Alexandra had an embarrassing date when she was 15 – a friend set her up with a boy for a movie date and she spent two hours putting on make-up for that. After the date, her friend called her up to say that the guy said she looked weird as she had too much make-up on.</p><p lang=und dir=ltr>? <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/yjQNMRw6QD</a></p><p>— Alexandra Daddario (@AADaddario) <a rel=nofollow href=#>September 17, 2021</a></p><p>As Alexandra now says, ‘I’m very low-key and pretty much a homebody,’ and recalled always wanting to date someone but wasn’t successful. Fans found that hard to believe, as she has stunning looks with her striking blue eyes. When she was younger, she was a nerdy kid with braces, so boys didn’t want to date her. However, as she became famous, guys started to notice her, and would try to get her attention in different ways, some of them bad. She’s said that a man didn’t really need to try very hard to get her attention, or have abs for her to be attracted to him. What’s way important for her is to connect really well with the guy.</p><h3><span id=Jason_Fuchs>Jason Fuchs</span></h3><p>Alexandra’s first known boyfriend since she became a celebrity had been Jason Fuchs; they dated from 2006 until 2009, but she’s pretty much tight-lipped about their relationship. Being the same age and working as an actor when they were very young, it wasn’t surprising that the two hooked-up after they met. Nobody knew why they subsequently called it quits.</p><p>BREAKING NEWS: Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment have hired Wonder Woman screenwriter Jason Fuchs to pen a Lobo script.http://www.thewrap.com/wbs-lobo-lands-wonder-woman-writer-jason-fuchs-exclusive/(David)</p><p>Posted by <a rel=nofollow href=#>DC Entertainment Universe</a> on&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Wednesday, March 16, 2016</a></p><p>Jason Fuchs is an American movie and TV actor, but it was his work as a screenwriter that landed him on Forbes 30 Under 30 list in 2015. He co-wrote the screenplay of the animated adventure “Ice Age: Continental Drift,” the fourth film in the “Ice Age” franchise. It premiered in 2012 and made a killing at the box office taking close to $900 million, making it the fifth highest-grossing movie that year. He co-wrote the story of “Wonder Woman” too, based on the DC Comics superhero of the same name. It was released in theatres worldwide in 2017, and was a huge success with over $800 million in gross earnings.</p><h3><span id=Trey_Songz>Trey Songz</span></h3><p>In 2011, Alexandra was rumored to have briefly dated Trey Songz. There’s not much information about them being a couple, but the speculation started when they worked together in the 2013 horror-slasher, “Texas Chainsaw 3D,” the seventh movie in “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” franchise.
